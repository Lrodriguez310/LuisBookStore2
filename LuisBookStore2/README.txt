2022 11 7 1628

updated migrations to fit my .net 3.0.  Had to change them because I accidentally selected 5.0 support instead of 
3.0.  Updated all packages to fit project.

2022 11 7 1630

running project... no errors ... everything looks good.

2022 11 7 1637  ------- Migration 1

add-migration AddDefaultIdentityMigration   adding migrations to tools nuget packet manager and then console
File Name was made 2022 11 07 1637  AddDefaultIdentityMigration.cs => 20221107214401_AddDefaultIdentityMigration.cs

2022 11 7 1640

There was an error  when trying to add migration

tried commenting out some parts of the database under appsettings.json

//"Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=aspnet-LuisBookStore-E9FF903B-01C6-4B3E-9B94-1D539FA70443;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"

2022 11 7 1644

Had to change the default project to LuisBooks.DataAccess in order to get things to work out

2022 11 7 1701

updated the database using "update-database" in the package database console.  


2022 11 7 1723

added new class to luisbookstore.models called category.cs then populated it with a key and a getter and setter.

2022 11 7 1727 

updated application Db context.cs

2022 11 7 1729  ------ Migration 2

package manager console 

add-migration AddCategoryToDb

File Name: AddCategoryToDb => 20221107222829_AddCategoryToDb.cs




added category section to database


2022 11 7 1748

was having trouble with the Irepository.cs but found a way to fix it. At first I had Expressions in the plural and then I made it singular.

2022 11 7 1757

updated the Irepository.cs and added void methods as the index some to remove an entity , one to add an entity, and other ways to remove an entity.

2022 11 7 1805


Worked on Repository.cs add the right usings and the correct public classes and privates classes. Made sure there were no errors.

I misspelled a lot of things went back and fixed it.

0 ERRORS/




2022 11 7 1811

adding category.cs
and adding an interface Icategory.cs

updating category.cs putting in the data to link to Icategory and .dataaccess project.

no errors so far.





2022 11 7 1814

updated the IcateogryRepository interface. Linked it to Irepository < category> 

Fixed error in CategoryRepository.cs by adding 

public void Update(Category category)
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }

        this alleviated the errors.

2022 11 7 1817

In the CategoryRepository.cs
used .NET LINQ to retrieve the first or default category object
           then passed the id as a generic entity which matters the category ID




2022 11 7 1821

modified categoryrepository.cs with the using statments at the beginning
used .NET LINQ to retrieve the first or default category object
           then passed the id as a generic entity which matters the category ID
modified Icategoryrepository.cs also with using statements at the beginning and also added code




2022 11 7 1824

added isp_call.cs as an interface added the following code

 // e.g first column of first row in the result set
        T Single<T>(string procedurename, DynamicParameters param = null);

// execute something to the database but not retreive anything

        void Execute(string procedurename, DynamicParameters param = null);

// retrieves the complete row or record

        T OneRecord<T>(string procedurename, DynamicParameters param = null);

 //get all of the rows

        IEnumerable<T> List<T>(string procedurename, DynamicParameters param = null);

 // stored procedure that returns two tables

        Tuple<IEnumerable<T1>, IEnumerable<T2>> List<T1, T2>(string procedurename, DynamicParameters param = null);




2022 11 7 1840

added class SP_Call and added code to connect it 

// Access the Database
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _db;
        private static string ConnectionString = ""; // this is needed to call the stored procedures

        //Constructor to open Sql Database




2022 11 7 1843

SP_Call commmented out all of the throw exceptions out and added new connections to the sql
private static string ConnectionString = ""; // this is needed to call the stored procedures
getting SQL connections for the SP_Call class.




2022 11 7 1855

updated the rest of the SP_Call had an error and forgot to add the rest of the code. found where to add it and cleared it.


2022 11 7 1857

made the method public to access the class
made the using statement
 applied constructor to use DI and inject in to the repositories
all changes will be saved when the save method is called at the parent level




2022 11 7 1900

added to start up.cs 

services.AddScoped<IUnitOfWork, UnitOfWork>();

2022 11 7 1901

I had an error ... working on it trying to find a solution

2022 11 8 1100

2022 11 8 1108

Now adding a view into the category folder named index.cshtml

2022 11 8 1110

added code into the index.cshtml 
This will be for the table
I will now run the application

Everything is running well

2022 11 8 1116

went into _Layout.cshtml

Added the Category into the index html 

and put it under the contentmanagement. The page is working and the table is trying to create but we
have not made a create folder just yet.
I have also commented out the Action tag under content management to make space for Category in the content management dropdown.

Gave the Category the class name dropdown item to fit into the content management drop down.

2022 11 8 1140

added a new div into the index.cshtml which includes a icon for deletion and insertion
